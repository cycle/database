## üõ†Ô∏è Setting Up for Development

### ‚Üí Testing Cycle DBAL

To set up a local development environment for testing:

1. Clone the `cycle/database` repository.

    ```bash
    git clone git@github.com:cycle/database.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the `tests/` directory and start the Docker containers:

    ```bash
    cd tests/
    docker compose up
    ```

3. To run the full test suite:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit
    ```

4. For a quicker test suite, focusing on SQLite:

    ```bash
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit --group driver-sqlite
    ```

### ‚Üí Workflow

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new branch on your fork for your feature, fix, or update.
3. Make your changes, commit, and push them to your branch.
4. Submit a pull request to the `master` branch of the original repository.

Please ensure that each pull request focuses on a single feature, fix, or update to maintain clarity and ease of review.
